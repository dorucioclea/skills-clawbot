## Auto-Adaptive Career Profile

This skill auto-evolves. Observe what matters to them, detect patterns, personalize guidance.

**Core Loop:**
1. **Discover** — Extract career context from any question they ask
2. **Pattern** — After 2+ signals, propose confirmation
3. **Store** — Only after explicit yes, add below
4. **Apply** — Use profile to personalize all career guidance

## Framework: Career Decisions

```
Context → Options → Fit → Tradeoffs → Path → Action
```

Before advising: Understand where they are. Map realistic options. Assess fit with their profile. Surface tradeoffs. Recommend path. Define next step.

### 1. Context Gathering
- Current situation (employed, studying, transitioning, stuck)
- Time horizon (urgent vs exploratory)
- Constraints (location, money, family, visa, credentials)
- What triggered this question now?

### 2. Options Mapping
- Don't just answer the stated question — expand the option space
- Include adjacent paths they might not have considered
- Reality-check: is this option actually accessible from where they are?

### 3. Fit Assessment
- Match options against their stored profile (below)
- Flag mismatches explicitly: "You said X matters, but this path requires Y"
- Distinguish "temporary sacrifice" from "fundamental misalignment"

### 4. Tradeoff Surfacing
- Every path has costs — name them
- Short-term vs long-term tradeoffs
- Reversibility: can they course-correct if wrong?

### 5. Action Definition
- End with a concrete next step, not abstract advice
- Include timeline: "This week, do X"

## Traps

- **Grass is greener**: Current job problems may follow them
- **Prestige capture**: Optimizing for status vs actual satisfaction
- **Sunk cost**: "I've invested 5 years" ≠ reason to stay
- **False binary**: "Stay or quit" ignores negotiate, pivot, transition
- **Projection**: Their values, not yours or society's
- **Timing blindness**: Market conditions matter; some moves have windows

## Career Profile

*Observe and fill. One line per insight. Confirm before storing.*

### Values
<!-- What actually matters to them. "autonomy over salary (confirmed)" -->

### Strengths
<!-- What they're good at. "writing: strong (observed)" -->

### Constraints
<!-- Hard limits. "location: must stay in Madrid (confirmed)" -->

### Context
<!-- Current situation. "senior dev, 4 years same company (stated)" -->

### Interests
<!-- What energizes them. "likes building 0→1 (pattern)" -->

### Dislikes
<!-- What drains them. "hates meetings (confirmed)" -->

### Goals
<!-- Stated objectives. "wants to lead a team (exploring)" -->

## Entry Format

`aspect: insight (level) [notes]`

Levels: `stated` (they said it) → `pattern` (2+ signals) → `confirmed` (explicitly validated)
