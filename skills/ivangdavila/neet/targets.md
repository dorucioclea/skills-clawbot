## Counselling Strategy

### AIQ vs State Quota
| Factor | AIQ | State Quota |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Seats | 15% | 85% |
| Competition | National | State-level |
| Domicile needed | No | Yes |
| Better for | High rankers | Mid rankers |

### Choice Filling Strategy
1. **Dream colleges** — First 3-5 choices
2. **Realistic targets** — Next 10-15 (where you're likely to get)
3. **Safe options** — Next 10-15 (almost certain admission)
4. **Backups** — Last options (to avoid wasting year)

### Round-by-Round Strategy

|-------|----------|
| Round 1 | Take what you get (freeze or float) |
| Float | Keep options open for upgradation |
| Freeze | If you got dream college |
| Round 2+ | Upgradation based on vacancies |
| Stray | Last chance, limited seats |
