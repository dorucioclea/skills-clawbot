# Self-Reflection Prompts

## Quick Check (10 seconds)
- "Did I actually answer what was asked?"

## Standard Review (30 seconds)
- "What would a skeptic say about this?"
- "What am I assuming that might be wrong?"
- "What's the weakest part?"

## Deep Reflection (2 minutes)
- "If I had to defend this to an expert, where would I struggle?"
- "What information would make me change this completely?"
- "Am I being lazy anywhere?"
- "What would the best version of this look like?"
- "If this fails, what will be the reason?"

## Post-Mortem (after completion)
- "What did I learn that I didn't know before?"
- "What would I do differently next time?"
- "What took longer than expected and why?"

## Confidence Calibration
- "On a scale of 1-10, how confident am I?"
- "What specific evidence supports that number?"
- "What would need to be true to be a 9?"
